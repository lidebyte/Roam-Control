## About

Roam Control is an iPhone app for location-based development, quality assurance and responsible personal testing on a device you own and control.

It supports fixed reported locations, simulated walking routes, favourites, history, on-device pairing and guided LocalDevVPN-compatible sessions.

Roam Control is distributed as a prebuilt IPA. The application source code is not publicly distributed.
